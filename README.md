🥔 Chips Market Sales Analysis
This project is part of the Quantium Virtual Internship on Forage. It simulates a real-world business scenario using retail sales data focused on the chips category. The internship involved analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and marketing effectiveness using Python, Excel, and PowerPoint.

📊 Project Overview
The goal was to turn raw retail transaction data into actionable insights for both business and technical stakeholders. The analysis supports smarter decisions in product performance tracking, customer segmentation, and campaign evaluation.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy) – for data wrangling, statistical tests, and visualizations
Excel – for initial exploration and file preparation
PowerPoint – to present final insights and strategic recommendations
📌 Project Highlights
🔹 Task 1: Customer Segmentation & Product Insights
Analyzed brand preferences and pack size trends
Compared average unit prices, quantities, and sales volume across segments
Insight: Mainstream Young Singles/Couples bought the most chips; Celica had highest retention %
🔹 Task 2: Trial Store Performance Evaluation
Identified control stores using correlation and magnitude distance techniques
Measured trial impact using sales lift and t-statistics
Insight: Trial stores showed measurable performance differences, with 95% confidence intervals used to validate results
🔹 Task 3: Executive Presentation
Created an executive-style slide deck to summarize findings from Tasks 1 and 2
Provided visual summaries and data-backed recommendations
🚀 What I Achieved
Applied statistical techniques (correlation, t-tests, normalization) to real-world retail data
Developed a clear presentation and report tailored to business stakeholders
Learned to evaluate test vs. control store performance using Python
⚙️ Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Managing long workflows across 3 tasks	Broke the work into reproducible Python scripts and modules
Handling missing days in transaction data	Generated full date sequences and merged to find gaps
Plotting multi-line comparisons (trial, control, confidence bands)	Standardized visual format and fixed slice logic
✅ Recommendations
Focus promotions on segments with high unit purchases (e.g., Mainstream Young Singles/Couples)
Monitor trial stores against matched control stores using normalized sales and statistical thresholds
Continue testing in smaller, low-risk markets to refine marketing effectiveness
