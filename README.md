🥔 Chips Market Sales Analysis

This project was completed as part of the Quantium Virtual Internship Program on Forage. It simulates a real-world retail analytics scenario using transaction-level sales data from the chips category. The project focuses on understanding customer behavior, evaluating product performance, and measuring the effectiveness of in-store trials.

📊 Project Overview

The objective of this analysis was to transform raw retail transaction data into actionable business insights. The project supports decision-making related to customer segmentation, product performance, and marketing trial evaluation, with findings communicated to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy) – data cleaning, analysis, statistical testing, and visualization

Excel – initial data exploration and preparation

PowerPoint – executive-style presentation of insights and recommendations

📌 Project Structure & Key Tasks
🔹 Task 1: Customer Segmentation & Product Insights

Analyzed customer segments based on life stage and purchasing behavior

Evaluated brand preferences and pack size trends

Compared average unit price, quantity purchased, and total sales across segments

Key Insight:

Mainstream Young Singles/Couples purchased the highest volume of chips

Celica showed the highest customer retention percentage

🔹 Task 2: Trial Store Performance Evaluation

Selected suitable control stores using correlation and magnitude distance methods

Compared trial and control store performance using normalized sales metrics

Evaluated trial impact using sales lift, t-tests, and 95% confidence intervals

Key Insight:

Trial stores showed statistically measurable performance differences compared to control stores

🔹 Task 3: Executive Presentation

Created an executive-style slide deck summarizing findings from Tasks 1 and 2

Presented insights using clear visualizations and data-backed recommendations

Focused on business impact and actionable outcomes

🚀 What I Achieved

Applied statistical techniques such as correlation analysis, normalization, and t-tests to retail transaction data

Conducted end-to-end customer and store performance analysis using Python

Developed clear, stakeholder-focused insights and recommendations

Strengthened skills in experimental analysis (trial vs. control evaluation)

⚙️ Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Managing a long workflow across multiple tasks	Broke analysis into reproducible Python scripts and modular steps
Missing dates in transaction data	Generated complete date ranges and merged datasets to identify gaps
Visualizing multi-line comparisons (trial vs. control vs. confidence bands)	Standardized plotting logic and visual formatting
